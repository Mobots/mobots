\b map_visualisation is a plugin in Rviz to visualize a map from image tiles.

Each image tile is assigned a pose and a unique ID. Optionally, additional
poses can be added to images, which enables the use of several pose coordinate
systems. The ImageMapInfo is a seperate node which supports the plugin with
additional user interfaces.
