## This plugin includes Qt widgets, so we must include Qt like so:
find_package(Qt4 COMPONENTS QtCore QtGui REQUIRED)
include(${QT_USE_FILE})

## I prefer the Qt signals and slots to avoid defining "emit", "slots",
## etc because they can conflict with boost signals, so define QT_NO_KEYWORDS here.
add_definitions(-DQT_NO_KEYWORDS)

## Here we specify the list of source files
set(SOURCE_FILES

## An rviz plugin is just a shared library, so here we declare the
